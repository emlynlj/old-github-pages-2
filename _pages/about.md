THANKS FOR PLAYING
-----
**We broke some records with the KSP server, and we had great fun. However, it's the new year, and the event has ended. Thanks for playing!**

Hey there and welcome to the yearly Spitter KSP server!

Before you can get playing, please check the mods that you need to play on the server - your experience may not be good without them. 

Do not install any part or gameplay mods that aren't on the list or other people won't see your craft.

Visual mods are fine!


**DO NOT USE TWEAKSCALE**


Note: Some mods will bundle the dependencies with them. In that case, you don't need to install what was bundled.
